# Penn-Pal App Backend

We use the Strapi headless CMS for most of the backend development, together with a Postgres Database hosted publicly.
For development it is best to have a local database for testing purposes. 
Instructions on how to start with Strapi are below. 

## Notes for Development
This code has been configured so that it can be run locally with a local Postgres database.
To develop with a local database, configure with the proper environment variable `ENV_PATH` as follows:

```shell
ENV_PATH=/Users/<username>/penn-pal-backend/.env.dev yarn develop
```
Please substitute <username> with the one used on your Mac.
It is assumed that you already have a ".env.dev" file set up for storing the desired environment variable values like the below:

```dotenv
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=1337

DATABASE_HOST=127.0.0.1
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_NAME=tobemodified
DATABASE_USERNAME=tobemodified
DATABASE_PASSWORD=tobemodified
DATABASE_SSL=false

APP_KEYS="toBeModified1,toBeModified2"
API_TOKEN_SALT=tobemodified
ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=tobemodified
JWT_SECRET=tobemodified
```
